* **Definition**

   A $D$-dimensional positive geometry is a pair $(X, X_{\geq 0})$, where $X$ is a complex projective algebraic variety of complex
   dimension $D$, and  $X_{\geq 0}$ is an oriented subset of the real part of $X$, of real dimension $D$. Every positive geometry is equipped with a unique non-zero differential
   $D$-form $\Omega(X, X_{\geq 0})$ satisfying the following recursive axioms:
   * For $D=0$ we have that $X = X_{\geq 0}$ is a single real point and $\Omega(X, X_{\geq 0}) = \pm1$ depending on the orientation of $X_{\geq 0}$. 
   * For $D > 0$ we have that every boundary component $(C, C_{\geq 0})$ of $(X, X_{\geq 0})$ is a positive geometry of dimension $D âˆ’ 1$. Moreover, the form $\Omega(X,   X_{\geq0})$ is constrained by the residue relation
   
        $$\text{Res}_C \Omega(X, X_{\geq0}) = \Omega(C, C_{\geq0})$$
        
        along every boundary component $C$, and has no singularities elsewhere.
